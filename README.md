# loudness-extractor
Detect the presence and loudness of audio from some audio input on your computer by recording and analyzing a wav file from the source.
Relies on PyAudio (https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/) for recording. Install it using `python -m pip install pyaudio`.


In progress.

Future additions:
On first time setup, take a sample measurement from the source to determine the quiet level of the microphone. Or, perhaps leave the measurements fully unscaled.

My plans are to extend the output generated by this program to applications such as volume auto-ducking and music selection.
